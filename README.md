Demo Angular v17 application demonstrating D3 network force diagram.

## Summary

This demo lets you interactively try various settings and combinations of forces for [d3-force](https://github.com/d3/d3-force).

It's based on [Mike Bostock's](https://bost.ocks.org/) example code for a [force directed graph](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/2675ff61ea5e063ede2b5d63c08020c7).

In order to make this demo more Angular like, I have integrated the actions into the proper Angular life cycle hooks and have replaced the plain input controls with the nicer looking Material components.
